script works on many unix/linux computers, tested on my android with busy box and pc with ubuntu 17.04
tryed to make it as small as it can be
OLD_script.sh is the old one, newer one downloads the site only once and never writes to disk
but the old one downloads twice and writes to disk, i was a newbie when creating the older one
